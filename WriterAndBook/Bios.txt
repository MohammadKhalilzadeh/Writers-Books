Hafez was born in Shiraz, Iran. His parents were from Kazerun, Fars Province. 
Despite his profound effect on Persian life and culture and his enduring popularity
 and influence, few details of his life are known. Accounts of his early life rely 
upon traditional anecdotes. Early tazkiras (biographical sketches) mentioning Hafez
 are generally considered unreliable. At an early age, he memorized the Quran
 and was given the title of Hafez, which he later used as his pen name.
The preface of his Divan, in which his early life is
 discussed, was written by an unknown contemporary whose name may have been Mohammad
 Golandam.Two of the most highly regarded modern editions of Hafez's Divan are 
compiled by Mohammad Ghazvini and Qasem ?ani (495 ghazals) and by Parviz
 Natel-Khanlari (486 ghazals).
Modern scholars generally agree that Hafez was born either in 1315 or 1317. 
According to an account by Jami, Hafez died in 1390. Hafez was supported 
by patronage from several successive local regimes: Shah Abu Ishaq, who came to
 power while Hafez was in his teens; Timur at the end of his life; and even the
 strict ruler Shah Mubariz ud-Din Muhammad (Mubariz Muzaffar). Though his work 
flourished most under the 27-year rule of Jalal ud-Din Shah Shuja (Shah Shuja),
it is claimed Hafez briefly fell out of favor with Shah Shuja for mocking 
inferior poets (Shah Shuja wrote poetry himself and may have taken the comments 
personally), forcing Hafez to flee from Shiraz to Isfahan and Yazd, but no historical
 evidence is available.He is said to have been in Timur's court, as Hafez wrote 
a ghazal whose verse says if this Turk accept his homage:

-For the black mole on her cheek

I would give the cities of Samarkand and Bukhara

Timur upbraided him for this verse and said; "By the blows of my well
 tempered sword I have conquered the greater part of the world to enlarge
 Samarkand and Bukhara, my capitals and residences; and you pitiful creature
 would exchange these two cities for a mole". Hafez replied "O Sovereign of
 the world; "It is by the state of similar generosity that I have been reduced,
 as you see my present state of poverty." It is reported that the King was 
amazed by the witty answer, and the poet departed with magnificent gifts.

His mausoleum, Hafezieh, is located in the Musalla Gardens of Shiraz.
